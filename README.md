# FreeCAD-Trainning-Exercise
Training example for freecad
All the example are coming from [this document from A_3](http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=19934#p153850). there is Gif Image for each Freecad example, to explain the step by step design used.
many other design steps are possible, depending on each designer ...

All example are done with FreeCAD 0.17, mainly to learn workflow of PArt design Next. Some bug (2017/02/15) are stucking me on the possibilities I saw to design complicated part for the moment
